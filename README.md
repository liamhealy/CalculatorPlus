# CalculatorPlus
This repository contains the code for an arduino calculator. Arduino code is written in C++, however in combination with the arduino's hardware, the arduino IDE allows us to use special libraries to create sketches. A "sketch" is what we call an arduino code file, and the extension for such files is `.ino`. For simplicities sake I saved this arduino code in a C++ file.
